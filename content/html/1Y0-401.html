<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">1Y0-401 training course is a collection of video lectures that advances one's understanding of XenDesktop 7.6 design, implementation and installation. The student will apply several computational algorithms in order to achieve the optimal workability of the XenDesktop app. The units covered are based on the current design and setup of the IT environment. Consequently, all the concepts are transitional in the sense that the beginning of every concept is the ending of the previous one. The student should not skip any lecture in the essence of time utility because it will affect the understanding in the succeeding lectures.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Every student who is eligible to study this course has the capability to &nbsp;pass the related exam as well as the training is instructor-led. The major topics are always elaborated using different teaching aids that are provided by the team that has made the learning of the course affordable. The instructor takes precise and actual steps that are considered pivotal in the configuration and installation of XenDesktop 7.6.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Citrix XenDesktop 7.6 is the latest technological innovation that has been through enormous and continuous updates as the technological trends necessitate. It is implemented in a way that the end-users have access to the centralized desktop app using the Citrix Receiver features. The knowledge of this course is concerned with the acquisition of the skills such as Machine Catalogs Customization, Delegated Administration, Citrix Printing, Microsoft GPMC, and various XenDesktop technologies. The wide application of Citrix Receiver is where there is a centralized database of an organization like that of a bank virtually shared throughout its branches. This enhances credibility as well as integrity because a task performed at a particular branch is reflected in all the branches sharing the database.</span></p>

<ol>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">The teaching of this course cannot be compared with any other related exam elsewhere. It teaches every concept as we expected. I do recommend it to anyone who has a dream of using XenDesktop application.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Great! I have all that I needed in the software engineering field. The lectures have first introduced me to the software engineering concepts. I appreciate the guideline I received before starting this course.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">The instructor does not expound on the complex topics as I expected. Majority of us did not enroll to get the certification but rather to acquire the knowledge. I think we should revisit topics like the Citrix Receiver.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Some of the videos end unexpectedly while others do not play at all. How can I move to the next lecture without the knowledge of the previous lecture? A lookup should be done by the authority concerned.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%; color: red;">I just fail this exam because some content was not available in this training. I think the administration should issue a retake that is not paid for to retain their reputation. It is the only crisis I have ever seen. -&nbsp;&nbsp; CHECK IF WE NEED SUCH COMMENT =) </span></li>
