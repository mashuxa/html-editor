<ol>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Great! I have had a dream of becoming Cisco engineer but I understand I have to receive recognition by passing several Cisco exams. I believe I can, 210-065 has just opened the doors and new opportunities.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">The secret of passing is not attending all the lectures that are associated with the exam you are preparing for. The secret is taking notes whenever you are in the lecture however the concept may seem easy, take notes.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">The prerequisites of this course are stated not to limit the number of candidates doing the exam but to ensure that we get the concepts easily. Cisco training is a chain of various certifications.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Wow! The instructor has full command of the English language. Effective communication is always the key to understanding. The instructor has no accent that can let you fail.</span></li>
    <li style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Unbelievable! The long training has just ended unexpectedly. I feel it should have continued because it was so much enlightening. I am looking forward to having the instructor in the preceding certification.</span></li>
